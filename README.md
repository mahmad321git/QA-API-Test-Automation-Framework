# QA-API-Test-Automation-Framework

<h3> Problem - Statement: </h3>
There are several# of backend API's that are built and linked with the on-premise database and have been migrated onto the cloud. These are being built using the micro-services architecture. As an Automation Enginner you have to verify that API'S are successfully migrated.

<h3> Problem - Solution: </h3>
<p>So in-order to solve this problem First we have to identify how many services that needs to be tested? and with in each service how many API's that are being built? and with-in each API how many different end points it has?</br></p>
<p> Lets take an Considerate Assumption:</br>
-# of Services that needs to be tested: 10</br>
-# of API's that Exist with in the service: 10</br>
-# of End points with in an API: 10 </br></p>
